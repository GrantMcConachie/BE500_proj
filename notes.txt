~~ State Variables ~~

S - self-control
C - craving

If C=0 it does not require much effort to quit. If C>0 the person is addicted. Craving dies of slowly and becomes unlearned

~~ Other variables ~~

E - External control about the positive effect of societal measures. Peer pressure is an example of negative E. (Hyperparam)

A - intensity of the frequency of addictive actions

A = A(C - S - E)

V - Addiction vulnerability

V = C - S - E

U - the degree of self control

S+ - maximum self control? (Hyperparam)

p - psychological resilience parameter

~~ General Notes ~~

dt = 1 week

~~ Things that annoy me ~~

"This may be justified by the fact that lifestyle exhibits a temporal cyclic pattern with
a period of one week" with no citation lmao

They don't introduce E till after they make a figure with it.
